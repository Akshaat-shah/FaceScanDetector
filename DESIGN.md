# Face Metrics Android App - Design Document

## Overview

The Face Metrics Android application provides real-time face detection and metrics visualization using the front-facing camera. The app processes camera frames to extract and display facial measurements, orientation data, and quality metrics.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Components

1. **User Interface Layer**
   - MainActivity: Primary activity that handles the camera preview and overlay
   - FaceOverlayView: Custom view for drawing metrics and bounding box

2. **Business Logic Layer**
   - FaceMetricsViewModel: Manages state and updates between UI and processing layers
   - FaceAnalyzer: Processes camera frames and detects faces
   - MetricsCalculator: Calculates facial metrics from detected face data

3. **Data Layer**
   - FaceMetrics: Data class that holds all facial measurements and scores

## Technical Implementation

### Camera Integration

The app uses the CameraX library to streamline camera operations:
- Preview use case for displaying camera feed
- Image analysis use case for processing frames
- Front camera selector for selfie-mode operation

### Face Detection

Google's ML Kit is used for face detection:
- Configured for high accuracy mode with all landmark detection
- Tracks facial features, contours, and basic classification
- Processes camera frames in real-time

### Metrics Calculation

Several types of metrics are calculated:
1. **Positional Metrics**
   - Bounding box coordinates
   - Interpupillary distance
   - Face size and position

2. **Orientation Metrics**
   - Pitch (head up/down)
   - Roll (head tilt)
   - Yaw (head left/right)

3. **Quality Metrics**
   - Overall face quality score
   - Landmark-based measurements
   - Eye state detection (blink, glasses)
   - Liveness probability

### UI Design

The interface consists of:
- Full-screen camera preview
- Semi-transparent overlay panels on each side for metrics
- Green bounding box around detected face
- Crosshair at the center of face

## Performance Considerations

- Face detection operations run on a background thread
- Only the most recent camera frame is processed to prevent queuing
- UI updates are efficiently handled through LiveData observers
- Memory usage is minimized by avoiding frame storage

## Security & Privacy

- All processing is done on-device without network transmission
- No facial data or images are stored permanently
- Camera permissions are requested at runtime with explanations

## Error Handling

The app handles several edge cases:
- Camera permission denials
- No face detected in frame
- Multiple faces detected (prioritizes largest/closest)
- Low-light conditions (reduced accuracy)

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements include:
- Support for additional facial metrics
- 3D face mesh visualization
- User-adjustable sensitivity settings
- Metrics history logging and analysis
- Comparison with reference images
- Face authentication capabilities
